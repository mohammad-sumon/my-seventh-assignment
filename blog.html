                There are two main types of browser storages: session and local
                storage. Their main difference is that local storage data does
                not expire, whereas session storage data gets cleared when the
                user closes its browser window. The storage capacity of local
                storage is 5MB/10MB. Whereas The storage capacity of session
                storage is 5MB. Local storage data must be deleted via
                javascript or manually. But Session storage data is stored only
                for the duration of a session.

                The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets
                are known as global variables and have global scope. Global
                scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of
                that program, any function or conditional state can access that
                variable. Whereas the Block scope is also a sub-type of local
                scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the
                variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly
                brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements, or
                something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables
                from within the curly brackets {}.

                JavaScript is a single-threaded language. In other words, it can
                do only one thing at a time. JavaScript executes all operations
                on a single thread, but using a few smart data structures, gives
                us the illusion of multi-threading. The event loop is the secret
                behind JavaScript asynchronous programming. The Event Loop has
                one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback
                Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the
                first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack,
                which effectively runs it.

                The undefined property indicates that a variable has not been
                assigned a value, or not declared at all. undefined is a
                property of the global object. That is, it is a variable in
                global scope. The initial value of undefined is the primitive
                value undefined. A variable that has not been assigned a value
                is of type undefined. A method or statement also returns
                undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have
                an assigned value. A function returns undefined if a value was
                not returned.
